MYWIZARD IN ACTION
WITH CLIENTS
Accenture helped a global beverage company to radically reduce costs and improve business service levels.

We combined our business process-led application outsourcing services with problem management, intelligent knowledge management and system stabilization routines. And, we used our myWizard intelligent automation platform to embed advanced analytics, insight and automation capabilities. The client experienced 65-70 percent reduction in overall ticket volume,
60-65 percent reduction in critical incidents and system availability improvement by 10-15 percent—leading to a reduction of total cost of ownership of several million dollars.


We helped one of the world’s top insurance companies to consolidate its IT landscape to make it easier to integrate future acquisitions and provide consistent service levels worldwide.

The Accenture Cognitive Robotics Solution automated the client’s reporting process for 200 servers and 30 applications, saving 2,000 manual hours per year, while improving accuracy. The Accenture myWizard® platform used advanced analytics to crunch project data and reveal insights that are used by the client’s team for service improvement plans. The results? End-to-end cost savings and up to 18 percent productivity improvement.

Accenture is helping a global telecommunications and technology company adopt more liquid, intelligent and automated approaches to application operations, as they shift to continuous software delivery.

Using Accenture myWizard®, Accenture was able to achieve significant cost reduction, efficiency and productivity gains, including a cost reduction of 24 percent over 3 years. It used Splunk-enabled Accenture Analytics for Application Management to embed advanced analytics, insight and automation capabilities across the client’s IT and business functions. For instance, batch operations automation helped reduce the team size by 40 percent through automation of reporting, SLA tracking and shift handovers. Similarly, customer issues are resolved faster thanks to automating more than 50 percent of the error analysis on customer orders in the company’s CRM, improving stability and accelerating mean time to issue identification by up to 90 percent. In addition, the company has benefitted from improved transparency and service, better visibility into the applications and faster time to repair.
